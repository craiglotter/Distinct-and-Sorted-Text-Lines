Distinct and Sorted Text Lines

Distinct and Sorted Text Lines is a small application that quickly removes duplicated lines and sorts all lines out alphabetically in a specified text document. Note that all empty or 'blank' lines will be removed from the result. For example:

  bbbb1
  aaaa1

  bbbb1

will become

  aaaa1
  bbbb1
